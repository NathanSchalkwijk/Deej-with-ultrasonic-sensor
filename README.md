# Deej-with-ultrasonic-sensor
Use an ultrasonic sensor for volume control with deej

1. Upload the file to your arduino and get the latest deej exe from https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases/tag/v0.9.10
2. configure deej by starting and closing it once and then opening the config file (more info on the deej github).
3. When you're done configuring your deej just plug in your arduino and start deej.
4. Now the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor controls your configured volume slider!
